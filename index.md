**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `max_agents` - Maximum number of parallel development agents (default: 5)
2. `branch_pattern` - Git branch naming pattern for implementations (default: "feature/task-{id}")
3. `review_mode` - Review strictness level: "strict", "balanced", "lenient" (default: "balanced")
4. `task_ids` - Comma-separated list of specific task IDs to implement (e.g., "2,3,7,15"). If not provided, automatically select available tasks without dependencies

**PHASE 1: TASK MASTER INTEGRATION ANALYSIS**

**üîç ADVANCED INFERENCE PROTOCOL: Deep Task Analysis**

Establish deep integration with Task Master using multi-modal reasoning:

**Meta-Cognitive Chain-of-Thought Analysis:**
1. Connect to Task Master and retrieve task information
2. **Reasoning Step**: Analyze task relationships and dependencies
3. If `task_ids` provided: Validate specified task IDs exist and are in pending status
   - **Confidence Check**: Verify all dependencies with 95%+ confidence
4. If `task_ids` NOT provided: Retrieve all pending tasks without dependencies
   - **Semantic Analysis**: Understand task intent and requirements
5. **PARALLELIZATION STRATEGY DECISION**: Intelligent mode selection
   - **IF multiple independent tasks available**: Execute **TASK-LEVEL PARALLELIZATION**
     * Each agent handles one complete task from start to finish
     * Maximum efficiency through task-level isolation
   - **IF only one task available**: Execute **SUBTASK-LEVEL PARALLELIZATION**  
     * Break single task into parallel subtasks
     * Multiple agents work on subtasks of the same parent task
   - **Confidence Threshold**: 85%+ confidence in strategy selection
6. Analyze task specifications and complexity requirements
   - **Complexity Scoring**: Rate each task 1-10 for implementation difficulty
7. For specified tasks: Verify dependencies are satisfied before proceeding
   - **Dependency Graph**: Build mental model of task relationships
8. For automatic selection: Identify tasks suitable for parallel development (no blocking dependencies)
   - **Optimization Algorithm**: Select tasks that maximize throughput
9. Evaluate task specifications for completeness and clarity
   - **Clarity Score**: 0-100% specification completeness rating
10. Prioritize tasks based on complexity, priority, and estimated development time
    - **Multi-Factor Ranking**: Weight priority (40%), complexity (30%), time (30%)

**Self-Consistency Validation**: 
- Generate 3+ independent task selection strategies
- Compare selections for consensus (>80% agreement required)
- If divergence detected, apply meta-reasoning to resolve

**Alternative Path Exploration**:
- Use Tree-of-Thoughts to explore task grouping permutations
- Apply counterfactual analysis: "What if we select different tasks?"
- Score each path using multi-criteria decision analysis

Think carefully about task selection criteria and how to maximize parallel development efficiency. When specific task IDs are provided, ensure all their dependencies are met before proceeding.

**PHASE 2: DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT RECONNAISSANCE**
Thoroughly analyze the current development environment state:
- Assess current git repository status and available worktree slots
- Identify existing worktrees and their current usage
- Create `.worktrees` directory in project root if it doesn't exist
- Verify git configuration and branch management capabilities
- Analyze codebase structure and shared dependencies
- Evaluate system resources for parallel agent execution

**PHASE 3: AGENT DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**
Based on Task Master analysis and environment assessment:
- Determine optimal number of parallel agents (respecting max_agents limit)
- Plan git worktree allocation strategy for task isolation within `.worktrees` directory
- Create worktree directory structure:
  ```
  .worktrees/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-1/     # Worktree for Task ID 1
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-3/     # Worktree for Task ID 3
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-7/     # Worktree for Task ID 7
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ```
- Design agent specialization roles (Developer, Reviewer, Corrector, Finalizer)
- Establish inter-agent communication and coordination protocols
- Create rollback and error recovery mechanisms

**PHASE 4: MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION**
Deploy specialized agents in coordinated parallel execution:

**Adaptive Agent Distribution Strategy:**

**TASK-LEVEL PARALLELIZATION** (Multiple independent tasks):
- For 1-3 tasks: Launch all development agents simultaneously  
- For 4-8 tasks: Launch in waves of 3-4 agents to manage coordination
- For 9+ tasks: Launch waves of max_agents size with queue management
- Each agent handles complete task lifecycle independently

**SUBTASK-LEVEL PARALLELIZATION** (Single task with subtasks):
- Break parent task into parallel subtasks
- Launch agents equal to number of subtasks (up to max_agents limit)
- Coordinate subtask integration and dependencies
- Ensure subtask agents communicate for consistency

**Development Agent Coordination Protocol:**
Each Development Agent receives:
1. **Task Context**: Complete task specification from Task Master
2. **Worktree Assignment**: Dedicated git worktree path for isolated development
3. **Implementation Guidelines**: Coding standards and architectural patterns
4. **Quality Requirements**: Definition of done and acceptance criteria
5. **Integration Points**: Dependencies and interface specifications

4. Skip this file for now (mark as unresolved)

What would you like to do for this conflict?
[Please provide your choice and any custom resolution if option 3]
```

**Resolution Execution Protocol:**
```
TASK: Apply user's conflict resolution decisions
