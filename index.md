**PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT COMMAND**

Think deeply about this parallel development orchestration task. You are about to embark on a sophisticated multi-agent development process integrated with Task Master.

**Variables:**

max_agents: $ARGUMENTS
branch_pattern: $ARGUMENTS
review_mode: $ARGUMENTS
task_ids: $ARGUMENTS

**ARGUMENTS PARSING:**
Parse the following arguments from "$ARGUMENTS":
1. `max_agents` - Maximum number of parallel development agents (default: 5)
2. `branch_pattern` - Git branch naming pattern for implementations (default: "feature/task-{id}")
3. `review_mode` - Review strictness level: "strict", "balanced", "lenient" (default: "balanced")
4. `task_ids` - Comma-separated list of specific task IDs to implement (e.g., "2,3,7,15"). If not provided, automatically select available tasks without dependencies

**PHASE 1: TASK MASTER INTEGRATION ANALYSIS**
Establish deep integration with Task Master to identify available work:
- Connect to Task Master and retrieve task information
- If `task_ids` provided: Validate specified task IDs exist and are in pending status
- If `task_ids` NOT provided: Retrieve all pending tasks without dependencies
- Analyze task specifications and complexity requirements
- For specified tasks: Verify dependencies are satisfied before proceeding
- For automatic selection: Identify tasks suitable for parallel development (no blocking dependencies)
- Evaluate task specifications for completeness and clarity
- Prioritize tasks based on complexity, priority, and estimated development time

Think carefully about task selection criteria and how to maximize parallel development efficiency. When specific task IDs are provided, ensure all their dependencies are met before proceeding.

**PHASE 2: DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT RECONNAISSANCE**
Thoroughly analyze the current development environment state:
- Assess current git repository status and available worktree slots
- Identify existing worktrees and their current usage
- Create `.worktrees` directory in project root if it doesn't exist
- Verify git configuration and branch management capabilities
- Analyze codebase structure and shared dependencies
- Evaluate system resources for parallel agent execution

**PHASE 3: AGENT DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**
Based on Task Master analysis and environment assessment:
- Determine optimal number of parallel agents (respecting max_agents limit)
- Plan git worktree allocation strategy for task isolation within `.worktrees` directory
- Create worktree directory structure:
  ```
  .worktrees/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-1/     # Worktree for Task ID 1
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-3/     # Worktree for Task ID 3
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-7/     # Worktree for Task ID 7
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
  ```
- Design agent specialization roles (Developer, Reviewer, Corrector, Finalizer)
- Establish inter-agent communication and coordination protocols
- Create rollback and error recovery mechanisms

**PHASE 4: MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION**
Deploy specialized agents in coordinated parallel execution:

**Agent Distribution Strategy:**
- For 1-3 tasks: Launch all development agents simultaneously
- For 4-8 tasks: Launch in waves of 3-4 agents to manage coordination
- For 9+ tasks: Launch waves of max_agents size with queue management

**Development Agent Coordination Protocol:**
Each Development Agent receives:
1. **Task Context**: Complete task specification from Task Master
2. **Worktree Assignment**: Dedicated git worktree path for isolated development
3. **Implementation Guidelines**: Coding standards and architectural patterns
4. **Quality Requirements**: Definition of done and acceptance criteria
5. **Integration Points**: Dependencies and interface specifications

**Development Agent Task Specification:**
```

   - Exclude task planning artifacts
   - Only commit actual code implementation files

DELIVERABLE: Task marked complete with clean integration (excluding AI artifacts)
```

**MERGE CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROTOCOL:**

When merge conflicts occur during finalization, execute the following interactive resolution process:

**Conflict Detection and Analysis:**
```
TASK: Handle merge conflicts for Task #{TASK_ID}

CONFLICT DETECTION WORKFLOW:

2. Analyze conflict types (content, rename, deletion conflicts)
3. Extract conflict context and competing changes
4. Prepare conflict summary for user presentation

CONFLICT ANALYSIS OUTPUT:
- List of conflicted files with line numbers
- Summary of competing changes for each conflict
- Context of why conflicts occurred
- Suggested resolution strategies
```

**User Interaction Protocol:**
```
CONFLICT PRESENTATION FORMAT:

=== MERGE CONFLICTS DETECTED FOR TASK #{TASK_ID} ===

Branch: {BRANCH_NAME}
Files with conflicts: {CONFLICTED_FILES_COUNT}

CONFLICT DETAILS:
{For each conflicted file:}
üìÑ File: {FILE_PATH}
üîç Conflict at lines {LINE_RANGE}

COMPETING CHANGES:
{CURRENT_BRANCH_CONTENT}

CONTEXT: {EXPLANATION_OF_CONFLICT}

RESOLUTION OPTIONS:
1. Accept current branch version (keep HEAD)
2. Accept task implementation version (keep incoming)
3. Manual merge (provide custom resolution)
4. Skip this file for now (mark as unresolved)

What would you like to do for this conflict?
[Please provide your choice and any custom resolution if option 3]
```

**Resolution Execution Protocol:**
```
TASK: Apply user's conflict resolution decisions

RESOLUTION APPLICATION WORKFLOW:
1. Parse user's resolution choice for each conflict
2. Apply resolution strategy:
   - Option 1: Accept current branch (`git checkout --ours {file}`)
   - Option 2: Accept task implementation (`git checkout --theirs {file}`)
   - Option 3: Apply user's custom resolution text
   - Option 4: Mark file as requiring manual attention later

3. For custom resolutions:
   - Replace conflict markers with user-provided content
   - Validate syntax if applicable (compile check for code files)
   - Ensure file integrity after resolution

4. Stage resolved files (`git add {resolved_files}`)
5. Create resolution commit with descriptive message
6. Continue with finalization process

RESOLUTION COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT:
"resolve: merge conflicts for task #{TASK_ID}

- {FILE1}: {RESOLUTION_STRATEGY}
- {FILE2}: {RESOLUTION_STRATEGY}
- ...

Task: {TASK_TITLE}
Conflicts resolved via user interaction"
```

**Advanced Conflict Handling:**
```
COMPLEX CONFLICT SCENARIOS:

1. MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING CONFLICTS:
   - Present conflicts in logical groupings
   - Allow batch resolution for similar conflicts
   - Provide "apply to all similar" option

2. BINARY FILE CONFLICTS:
   - Present file modification summaries
   - Offer clear choice between versions
   - Handle file renames and moves appropriately

3. DEPENDENCY CONFLICTS:
   - Analyze impact on related files
   - Suggest dependency resolution order
   - Warn about potential breaking changes

4. STRUCTURAL CONFLICTS:
   - Directory structure changes
   - File moves and renames
   - Package/module reorganization

USER DECISION VALIDATION:
- Verify custom resolutions don't break syntax
- Check for logical consistency in resolution choices
- Warn about potential integration issues
- Offer resolution preview before applying
```

**Parallel Execution Management:**

**PHASE 5: CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION ORCHESTRATION**
For sustained parallel development, orchestrate continuous task processing:

**Wave-Based Processing:**
1. **Task Queue Management**: Maintain queue of available tasks from Task Master
2. **Agent Pool Management**: Optimize agent allocation based on task complexity
3. **Worktree Lifecycle**: Manage creation, usage, and cleanup of git worktrees
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track completion rates and quality metrics
5. **Resource Optimization**: Balance parallel load with system capabilities

**Continuous Processing Cycle:**
```
IF task_ids provided:
    1. Validate all specified task IDs and their readiness
    2. Process specified tasks in optimal batches
ELSE:
    WHILE available_tasks > 0 AND system_capacity > threshold:
        1. Query Task Master for pending tasks without dependencies
        2. Select optimal task set for parallel processing
        
THEN:
    3. Allocate worktrees and launch Development Agents
    4. Monitor development progress and completion
    5. Deploy Review Agents for completed implementations
    6. Handle review outcomes (OK -> Finalization, Corrections -> Correction Agent)
    7. Process Correction Agent outputs through re-review cycle
    8. Execute Finalization Agents for approved implementations
    9. **IF merge conflicts detected -> Execute Merge Conflict Resolution Protocol**
    10. **Handle user interaction and apply conflict resolution decisions**
    11. Update Task Master status and clean up resources
    12. Assess system capacity for next wave (if automatic mode)
